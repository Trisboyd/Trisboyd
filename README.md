# I'm Tristan Boyd, software engineer extradordinaire*!
### *open to some interpretation

I'm a Full Stack MERN developer who also knows some python, SQL, and learning Solidity.  Also a musician mostly focusing on hitting loud things but with a good bit of string guys in there too (ie. drums, guitars, bass).

I got a superfluous amount of degress in the aforementioned hitting stuff category before completing a program in web development offered by [Practicum by Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.com/) and now I work t̶i̶r̶e̶l̶e̶s̶s̶l̶y̶  to create, update, and improve web applications for interested parties. Should you find yourself an employer interested in this work, feel free to reach out and offer me vast sums for my services.
