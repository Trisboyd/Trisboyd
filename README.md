# I'm Tristan Boyd

I'm a Full Stack MERN developer who also knows some python, SQL, and learning Solidity.  Also a musician mostly focusing on hitting loud things but with a good bit of string guys in there too (ie. drums, guitars, bass).

I got a superfluous amount of degress in the aforementioned hitting stuff category before completing a program in web development offered by [Practicum by Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.com/) and now I work to create, update, and improve web applications for interested parties. Should you find yourself an employer interested in this work, feel free to reach out and offer me vast sums for my services.

## Here are bullet points to avoid my verbosity:

- ðŸ‘¯ interested in Web 3.0
- ðŸ’¬ trying to read a book a month (mostly successful)
- not sure what the last bullet image should be
